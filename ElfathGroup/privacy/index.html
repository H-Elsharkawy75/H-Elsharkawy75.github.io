</strong></em></p>
<details>
<summary>Read More</summary>
<p><strong>(a) Information You Provide</strong></p>
<p>You may be asked to voluntarily give your personal information to an S&amp;P Real Estate Company when you interact with the S&amp;P Real Estate Company, including when you subscribe to a newsletter, request information or use a service provided by the S&amp;P Real Estate Company. In those circumstances, you can choose not to provide certain requested personal information, but then you might not be able to proceed with your intended interaction or transaction with the S&amp;P Real Estate Company or otherwise receive the full benefit of the desired service.</p>
<p>If you give an S&amp;P Real Estate Company the personal information of another individual, then you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws, including obtaining the individual’s valid consent, regarding your collection and disclosure of the personal information to the S&amp;P Real Estate Company and to the S&amp;P Real Estate Company’s use, disclosure and retention of the personal information.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Automated Collection</strong></p>
<p>An S&amp;P Real Estate Company may automatically collect certain information regarding your use of the S&amp;P Real Estate Company’s website, such as the dates and times that you use the website, the browsers, operating systems, software and devices that you use to access the website and details of your use of the website.</p>
<p>An S&amp;P Real Estate Company’s website, email messages and advertisements may use technologies (e.g. cookies, web beacons, tokens, pixels or tags) to collect information that assists the S&amp;P Real Estate Company to improve its products, services, customer communications and advertising and to prevent fraud.

<p><strong>(c) Information from Other Sources</strong></p>
<p>An S&amp;P Real Estate Company may collect personal information from various publicly available sources.</p>

<h3>5. How S&amp;P Real Estate Group Uses Personal Information</h3>

<details>
<summary>Read More</summary>
<p><strong>(a) General</strong></p>
<p>Each S&amp;P Real Estate Company may use your personal information collected by the S&amp;P Real Estate Company for purposes relating to or arising from your relationship and transactions with the S&amp;P Real Estate Company and as otherwise set out in this Privacy Policy or permitted by applicable law, including: (i) to administer your relationship with the S&amp;P Real Estate Company, including to contact and correspond with you regarding those matters; (ii) to facilitate your interactions and transactions with the S&amp;P Real Estate Company; (iii) to provide services to you; (iv) to process and respond to your inquiries, requests and other communications; (v) to provide you with information (including by email and other electronic messages) regarding the S&amp;P Real Estate Company and its business and services and services offered by other businesses, to the extent permitted by applicable law; (vi) to maintain, protect and improve the S&amp;P Real Estate Company’s services and to develop new services; (vii) to protect and enforce the S&amp;P Real Estate Company’s legal rights, interests and remedies and to protect the business, operations and customers of the S&amp;P Real Estate Company or other persons; and (viii) to assist other S&amp;P Real Estate Companies to collect, use, disclose and retain your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Subject to your right to withdraw consent as described in this Privacy Policy, S&amp;P may also use your personal information collected by S&amp;P for the following additional purposes that are not required for S&amp;P to provide you with services: (i) to administer and facilitate your participation in contests and promotions related to the S&amp;P Real Estate Company; and (ii) to communicate with you for the purposes of providing you with advertising and marketing messages pertaining to additional services that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Each S&amp;P Real Estate Company may combine your personal information collected by the S&amp;P Real Estate Company through various sources. S&amp;P may use your personal information to create non-personal information, and S&amp;P may then use, disclose, transfer and retain the non-personal information as set out below in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>(b) S&amp;P Real Estate Group</strong></p>
<p>Each S&amp;P Real Estate Company may share your personal information with the entire S&amp;P Real Estate Group, and the S&amp;P Real Estate Group may develop, maintain and share a confidential profile for you for use by each S&amp;P Real Estate Company to provide information and services to you, to facilitate your dealings with each S&amp;P Real Estate Company and as otherwise set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>(c) Interest-Based Advertising</strong></p>

Advertising vendors (such as Google, iovation and Facebook) use cookies, pixels or tokens – unique identifiers of a web browser on a specific computer that are installed on the computer when it accesses S&amp;P Real Estate Group websites – to display ads based on the computer’s past access to S&amp;P Real Estate Group websites. You can opt-out of Google&#8217;s use of cookies by visiting Google’s <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">Ads Settings</a>. You can also opt out of a remarketing vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1">Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer opt-out page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>(d) Information Regarding Referred Transactions</strong></p>
<p>If an S&amp;P Real Estate Company refers you to an independent business (e.g. a sales partner) for a proposed transaction (e.g. a purchase of a property), then the S&amp;P Real Estate Company may collect from that independent business information regarding the transaction for use by the S&amp;P Real Estate Company to update your confidential profile for use by the S&amp;P Real Estate Company as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
